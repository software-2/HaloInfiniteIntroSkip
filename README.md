# HaloInfiniteIntroSkip
Skip that long annoying intro video when Halo Infinite starts.

If you replace the intro video with a short video, it'll play that instead. You can manually do this or use the provided batch script to do it for you.

# Batch Script

Run **RemoveIntro.bat** to remove the intro, and **RestoreIntro.bat** if you want to bring it back.

This works on both the Steam and Xbox Store versions of the game.

# Manual Instructions

Replace this file with the one included in this repository. The file must be named "intro.mp4" - if you don't have a working video file with that name the game won't run.

C:\XboxGames\Halo Infinite\Content\videos\intro.mp4

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Halo Infinite\Content\videos\intro.mp4
